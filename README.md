# birthday_calculator
 Create a program that accepts a name and a birth date and displays the person’s birthday,the current day, the person’s age, and the number of days until the person’s next birthday.

Allow the user to enter a date in the MM/DD/YY format. Adjust the date so that it is correct even if the birth year is later than the current year.
When you calculate the person’s age, don’t take leap year into account. If the person is more than 2 years old, display the person’s age in years. Otherwise, display the person’s age in days.
When you display the message that indicates the number of days to the person’s birthday, you can use the following format for a person with a name of John: 
today - John's birthday is today!
tomorrow - John's birthday is tomorrow!
yesterday - John's birthday was yesterday!
other days - John's birthday is in X days
